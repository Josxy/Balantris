The balance is calculated by the center of mass of every piece tile. It applies a torque to rotate the board.
The formula = x axis of center of mass * total piece tile/speed adjuster
Speed adjuster is used to make the rotation more slow to decrease the difficulty. It becomes a lower value when score is getting higher and it increases the difficulty
